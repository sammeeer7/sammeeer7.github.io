    <h1>Hi, I'm Sameer ⚡</h1>
    <p>
      I’m an engineering student with a deep passion for <strong>building software</strong> and <strong>exploring AI</strong>. 
      Whether it’s solving real-world problems with code or diving into ML architectures, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently working on projects involving <em>machine learning, web development</em>, and <em>automation tools</em>.
      When I’m not coding, you’ll find me consuming anime and learning how things work under the hood.
